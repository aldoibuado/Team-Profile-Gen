  ## Description 
  In businesses there are going to be teams that will be assigned different tasks throughout the day. Even in schools, depending on the class, there may be group projects and being able to have a program that generates team profile with their information can be beneficial. To be able to build a program that allows me to test the skills I have learned so far has been good. It is always good to push ourselves and see what we can come up with. I learned how to write tests, put together a library and use object oriented programming.
